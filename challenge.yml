### Info:

Feedback is really important to keep our challenges improving!   
We might have an interesting challenge hidden for you all in this system.   

Flag is hidden inside the file /flag.txt on our system.   
There are multiple ways to extract it, however, if you want feedback system to send you your flag at your desired address.   
Trying executing `flag.sh` with first argument as your address   
E.g `./flag.sh https://webhook.site/You-Know-Where-To-Look-For-Me   `

Hope you have loads of fun!   
P.S: Hints will always be given at `CTFs` to those who look for it.
